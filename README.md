Google Assistant Euromillions Application for checking the latest lottery results

This is a JS application for interfacing with the Euromillions online XML that will enquire about the user's numbers and then check against the online xml for the correct numbers. Any numbers that the user gets correct will then be reccomended by the application for you to check further into your results online at the official site.

To get this application running you must first set up an account with DialogFlow by Google and set up the appropriate interactions for the user and then implement the code through the inline editor provided by Google.
